    title: "Canada-US Trade War and Tariff Crisis",
    summary: "In 2025, the United States imposed 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada except oil and energy (taxed at 10%). Canada retaliated with 25% counter-tariffs on CA$30 billion worth of US imports starting March 13, 2025. The tariffs created major economic uncertainty and threatened jobs. After negotiations, Canada removed most counter-tariffs effective September 1, 2025, keeping only tariffs on steel, aluminum, and auto imports. The trade war caused significant economic disruption and remains a major policy challenge.",

    summary: "The Canadian Dental Care Plan (CDCP) is now fully rolled out with 5.2 million Canadians enrolled as of October 2025. The program provides dental benefits to eligible Canadians with adjusted family income under $90,000.

The federal health minister confirmed the program will be spared from spending cuts despite ongoing implementation challenges.",

    title: "Immigration Levels Plan Reduces Targets for 2025-2027",
    summary: "Canada's 2025-2027 Immigration Levels Plan significantly reduced overall immigration targets and introduced new caps on temporary residents. The plan lowered refugee resettlement targets and shifted emphasis toward private rather than government sponsorship. New targets were introduced for student and worker arrivals, with student permits aligned with previously announced caps. The changes respond to concerns about housing shortages and strain on public services, but face criticism from educational institutions and businesses facing labour shortages.",

As a result of the crisis, several major government bills died on the order paper including a revised Online Harms Act, the Electoral Participation Act, and proposed increases to capital gains tax.

    summary: "With a federal election potentially only months away, the Liberal government's pharmacare program remains incomplete. While the program was promised as part of a supply and confidence agreement with the NDP, no deals have been signed with provinces and territories to pay for contraceptive and diabetes medication coverage. The future of the program is uncertain given the political instability, and critics argue implementation has been too slow despite the historic significance of expanding public healthcare.",

    summary: "The Bank of Canada's 2025 reports highlight major economic uncertainty caused by unpredictable US trade policy and tariff threats. While Canada's economy ended 2024 in a strong position with interest rate cuts boosting growth and inflation near 2%, the trade conflict is expected to slow growth and add price pressures. The Bank presented three possible economic scenarios due to uncertainty. High household mortgage debt remains a vulnerability, with high debt service costs weighing on household finances amid the economic uncertainty.",
